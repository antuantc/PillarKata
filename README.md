# PillarKata
Code Kata for Pillar

I use visual studio 2017 with .net core console project and xunit for testing

I ran the following command lines to setup my solution

dotnet new sln -n PillarKata
dotnet new console -n VendingMachines
dotnet new xunit -n VendingMachineTests

Then I added the two projects to the solution through visual studio 2017.
